      <description>Orientation Graphical displays are effective when they connect well with human visual and cognitive faculties. Humans are extremely good at some visual tasks and surprisingly poor at others. To illustrate, consider the task of identifying how many 3’s there are in the following list:
The task is difficult because recognizing shapes is a tough cognitive task.
The task becomes much simpler if we take advantage of color, which our visual systems can process very quickly.</description>

      <description>Orientation There are two major types of variables:
 Quantitative, where the value of the variable is a number. Categorical, where the value of the variable is one of a set of labels. That is, the value tells which category or group the row falls into.  It’s usually easy to tell what type a variable is by looking at the variable’s column in the data frame. But it’s also easy to tell from a point plot what are the types of the response and explanatory variables.</description>

      <description>Orientation There’s an expression about how to accomplish a complex, confusing, and difficult task: One step a at time. The purpose of this lesson is to provide you with a step-by-step procedure for working with data. Each step can be straightforward. Some steps involve informing yourself about the data at hand. Some steps require creativity and insight about the real-world system the data represents. Some steps require application of a particular technical procedure.</description>

      <description>Orientation A variable is a quantity or characteristic that varies from one person to another, or more generally, from one unit of observation to another. There are two distinct types of variables: quantitative (numeric) and categorical (labels/words/etc.).
There’s another distinction to be made about variables, which is not about the type of the variable itself but the role the variable will play in the statistical methods we use to describe a situation of interest and the relationships among the variables involved.</description>

      <description>Orientation Why is the word variable used to describe a column of a data frame? In mathematics, a variable is an unknown quantity. In math class, when they say “solve for x,” they mean figure out what the value of unknown x is.
In statistics, a variable is different. It’s a known quantity – known because you measured it, known because there it is, right in the data frame. This known quantity is called a variable because it takes on various different values in one row or another of the data frame.</description>

      <description>Orientation Consider a situation where you have three variables: X, Y, and C. Your understanding of how the world works is telling you that X causes Y. And, indeed, when you collect data, you see an association between X and Y. But all an association does is to tell you that X and Y are connected somehow, not what that connection is.
If you’re trying to convince a skeptic that X causes Y, you have some work to do.</description>

      <description>Orientation The appropriate choice of one variable as the response and other variables as the explanatory depends on the purpose for which you want to describe the relationship.
Consider these two distinct purposes:
“I plan to intervene to change the value of variable B, and I want to know how A will change in response.” (Example: “I’m going to turn down the thermostat setting, and I want to know whether water will condense on my windows.</description>

      <title>The standard deviation and the 95% summary interval</title>

      <description>Orientation The length of the 95% summary interval is a pretty good way to describe the amount of variation in a variable. Yet statisticians tend to prefer using the standard deviation. This makes sense, since statisticians are interested in confusing the poor student by using obscure names (“Deviation?”. Really?) and formulas that can be hard to understand. … Not really!! Even though the standard deviation has an odd name and seems complicated, the actual reason it’s used so much by statisticians is that it has some nice mathematical properties.</description>

      <description>Orientation English has many words to describe what statistician’s call frequency: common, unusual, rare, infrequent, uncommon, and so on. There’s no precise, numerical meaning to these words; they are used to create an impression.
In statistics, it’s helpful to have standard ways to refer to frequency. The standard deviation provides a widely accepted measure of commonality or rareness. It’s not just statisticians who use this measure. They are used in psychology and social science, in physical science (where the standard deviation is often called “sigma”).</description>

      <description>Showing various sorts of relationships for discussion Open up the linear regression Little App In this activity we’ll explore three different data sets available through the app. For each data set, the variable indicated below plays the role of the response variable. Some explanatory variables are listed as sub-points.
Data set: NHANES2. Response variable: BMI. It’s important for students to know what BMI is. Explanation from the CDC &amp;amp; BMI calculator for students.</description>

      <description>Orientation As you’ve probably figured out already, the columns of data frames are called variables because the values in the column are not all the same, that is, they vary.
In the early 1800s, it was discovered that many different variables have a pattern in common: the most common values are near the mean and values become less common the further they are from the mean. Not all variables have this pattern, but many do and so the pattern came to be called the normal distribution.</description>

      <guid>/lessons/normal-parameters/</guid>
      <description>Orientation The bell-shaped distribution is often a good description of the distribution of a variable, so often that it’s called the “normal” distribution.
Actually, there is not just one normal distribution but a whole family of them, all of which have the characteristic bell shape. To identify an individual member of this bell family, two numbers suffice:
 the mean: the location of the peak of the bell the standard deviation: the width of the bell  What’s potentially confusing here is that you may know about the mean in terms of a calculation you do on a variable: add up the n values and divide by n.</description>

      <title>What is a confidence interval?</title>

      <guid>/lessons/what-is-a-confidence-interval/</guid>
      <description>Orientation Statistics includes many forms and procedures for expressing uncertainty. A simple one is the assignment of a probability to a potential outcome. For instance, if we say the chance of rain tomorrow is 50%, we are expressing a large amount of uncertainty. In contrast, if the probability is specified as 10%, we are expressing much more certainty.
Another setting in which it’s helpful to express uncertainty involves a sample statistic such as the mean, standard deviation, median, correlation, regression slope, etc.</description>

      <title>Sampling bias and the confidence interval</title>

      <description>Orientation The lesson on What is a confidence interval? showed how confidence intervals are supposed to behave. Specifically, a 95% confidence interval should cover the corresponding population parameter for 95% of possible samples. Achieving this performance of course depends on the confidence interval being calculated with an appropriate procedure. But it also depends on the sample being unbiased.
An unbiased sample is one where each member of the population has exactly the same probability of being included in a sample.</description>

      <description>Orientation A friend and I were discussing ways to measure poverty. Of course, there’s the so-called “poverty level” of income defined by the US government. But we were interested in whether it might be worthwhile to do a detailed interview with, say, 100 families, quantifying how much trouble they have paying for different things: food, housing, healthcare, transportation, emergencies etc. Then we’d look at easy things to measure so that we could have an index for these different things, food stress, housing stress, and so on.</description>

      <description>Orientation We’re continuing the story of two friends interested in how to measure poverty. You met with them at a coffee shop to show them the NHANES data and how to display it in the t-test Little App. You had arranged the display to have income_poverty as the response variable and home_type as the explanatory variable. The sample size was n = 100, since that’s the number of families your friends were thinking of interviewing.</description>

      <description>Orientation Suppose you have an explanatory variable that defines two, distinct groups, like the home_type variable in the NHANES2 data. You notice that the two groups have different mean values for the explanatory variable.
A possible explanation for the observed difference in the two means is that it is just a pattern that reflects the play of chance rather than any systematic difference in the population of the two groups,</description>

      <guid>/lessons/relationship-patterns/</guid>
      <description>Orientation It’s natural to display a linear regression as a graph modeling the response variable as a function of the explanatory variables. In the LA_linear_regression Little App, that function is shown as a line laid on top of the data.
Graphics are important, but it’s also a good practice to summarize the relationship using words and numbers.
This lesson introduces the conventions for such a summary. Some of them may already be familiar to you.</description>

      <description>Orientation The statistical work we do is built around models. If the word “model” reminds you of a toy plane, you’re on the right track. A model is something we build in order to represent something in the real world. Usually the model is much simpler than the real-world object.
Models are useful when they serve a purpose. For instance, a toy plane can serve the purpose of teaching a child what are the main components of a plane and how they are related.</description>

      <description>Orientation Data can be many things, but one of the most common formats is a data frame, a kind of spreadsheet of rows and columns. We’ll work with the data frame Births_2014, which is based on data published by the US Centers for Disease Control. Births_2014 has 100,000 rows. Each row reports a live birth in the US in 2014. There are dozens of variables, a few of which are shown below.</description>

      <description> Orientation  Activity Systolic versus diastolic in NHANES. A stiff line is too strongly influenced by the people with very low diastolic blood pressure. Adding some flexibility allows the relationship for those with normal pressure to be more evident. I’m guessing very low diastolic pressure is OK, but you can’t lower systolic pressure accordingly and stay alive.
