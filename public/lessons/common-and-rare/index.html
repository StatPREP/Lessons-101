<h1>Orientation</h1>
<p>English has many words to describe what statistician’s call <em>frequency</em>: common, unusual, rare, infrequent, uncommon, and so on. There’s no precise, numerical meaning to these words; they are used to create an impression.</p>
<p>In statistics, it’s helpful to have standard ways to refer to frequency. The standard deviation provides a widely accepted measure of commonality or rareness. It’s not just statisticians who use this measure. They are used in psychology and social science, in physical science (where the standard deviation is often called “sigma”). In medicine, the standard deviation underlies a surprising number of diagnostic criteria. In criminal cases in court, the usual standard for evidence is “beyond a reasonable doubt.” But in civil discrimination cases, for instance employment discrimination or jury selection, the US Supreme Court has described compelling evidence as lying outside “two or three standard deviations.”</p>
<p>In this lesson, you are going to explore the use of the standard deviation as a kind of ruler for expressing frequency. For simplicity of speech, we’ll adopt the English words “common,” “uncommon,” and “rare” to refer to specific intervals:</p>
<ul>
<li>common: within 2 standard deviations of the mean. For a variable with a normal distribution, 95% of cases are common.</li>
<li>rare: beyond 3 standard deviations of the mean. For a variable with a normal distribution, a quarter of one percent (that is, 0.27%) of cases are beyond 3 standard deviations.</li>
<li>uncommon: not common but not rare. For a variable with a normal distribution, uncommon covers about 5% of cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since it’s so long-winded to say “within 2 standard deviations of the mean,” statisticians have adopted a scale called the <em>z-score</em>. In the language of the z-score, “within 2 standard deviations of the mean” is written <span class="math inline">\(|\ z\ | &lt; 2\)</span>. Similarly, “rare on the left size of the mean” is <span class="math inline">\(z &lt; -3\)</span>.</p>

<h1>Activity</h1>
<p>Open up the <a href="https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/LA_rare_and_common/">rare-and-common</a> Little App. Set the response variable to <code>height_adults</code> and leave the explanatory variable at <code>.none.</code>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The graphic shows a traditional blot of the distribution of the response variable, called a <em>density plot</em>. If you’re familiar with a histogram, you might like to think about a <em>density plot</em> as a kind of smoothed histogram without the jagged, abrupt changes from bar to var.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are sliders in the app to let you define numerically what range of values are common, uncommon, or rare.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Using your everyday experience, write down a range of human heights that you think of as “common.” Similarly, write down a tall height that’s rare and a short height that’s rare.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Within the app, set the sliders to correspond to what you wrote down for common and rare. According to the app, what fraction of cases fall into the ranges common, uncommon, and rare. Note that there are two ranges for uncommon: one on the left side of the mean and one on the right side. That’s also true for the ranges for rare.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Turn on <code>sex</code> as an explanatory variable.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What fraction of women are marked as either uncommon or rare on the tall side? What fraction of men?</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, what fraction of women are marked as uncommon or rare on the short side? Of men?</p></li>
<li>Adjust the sliders so that about 2.5% of women are marked as uncommon or rare on the tall side, and another 2.5% on the short side. Consequently, about 95% of women will be marked with a “common” height.
<ul>
<li>Applying that standard for men, what fraction lie outside the common range on the short and on the tall side? Are those fractions roughly the same?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Now think about the age of mothers of newborn. Write down young and old thresholds for “uncommon.”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set the explanatory variable to <code>.none.</code> and switch to the <code>Births_2014</code> data frame with <code>age_mother</code> as the response variable. According to the data, what fraction of mothers giving birth are uncommonly young? Uncommonly old?</p></li>
<li>Let’s turn things around. Adjust the sliders so that the “common” range includes the central 95% of the data.
<ul>
<li>Do the ages that define the “common” region look reasonable?</li>
<li>On the top of the graph is a scale marked in terms of standard deviations from the mean. How well does the 95% common range correspond to the theoretical cut-offs for a normal distribution?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Look for an explanatory variable that will split up the data into groups such that one group has a much higher fraction of uncommonly young births than another group.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Consider blood pressure. A high systolic blood pressure is generally defined to be at or above 130 mmHg.</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch back to the <code>NHANES</code> data frame and select <code>systolic</code> as the response variable. What fraction of the people in <code>NHANES</code> have a systolic pressure above 130 mmHg?</li>
<li>Set the explanatory variable to be <code>diabetes</code>. (You will also have to set the slider back to 130 mmHg.) Is there a difference in the fraction of people with diabetes who have high blood pressure compared to the fraction of people without diabetes with high blood pressure?</li>
</ul></li>
