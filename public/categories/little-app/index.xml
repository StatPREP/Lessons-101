      <description>Point plot Little App: Baby weight versus gestation in Births_2014. Click here to launch.   
The point-plot Little App provides a quick path to making data graphics. Select the data set, the response and explanatory variables, and youâ€™re there.
 You can map color to a covariate and can facet the graph (as shown above) by another covariate. Works with both quantitative and categorical variables on either or both axes, for color, and for faceting.</description>

The Jittering Little App shows how the general point-plot can be effective even when variables are categorical.
 Students can adjust the amount of jittering and transparency. Can stratify sampling by the explanatory variable.  Suggested StatPREP 101 activities  Jittering activity   </description>

The t-test Little App connects the t-interval to the .
 Length of confidence intervals as a function of n. Examine variation in the means and intervals by taking new samples from the population. Use the measuring stick to look at differences in means, lengths of confidence intervals, overlaps between confidence intervals, etc.</description>
