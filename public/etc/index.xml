      <description>Many instructors believe that learning is enhanced in a classroom where students are active participants rather than the passive recipients of a lecture. This document describes some general techniques for fostering an active classroom that can be used in a wide range of lesson topics. (There are also tips for specific topics included in the instructor guide for each topic.)
Whatâ€™s key is to constantly look for opportunities to force students to make a choice, offer a suggestion, or state an interpretation or an opinion.</description>

      <description>  Added an index.html under hugo-lithium/ to set homepage content.
 Added word-versions directory under static.  Used blogdown::build_dir(&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;) in lessons directory to build word versions of all lessons. Used OS tools to copy .docx files to the static/word-versions directory. Added a link at the bottom of each lesson .Rmd file to point to the word version.   </description>
