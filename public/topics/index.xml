 Correlation is not causation.
 Put on a more explicit logical footing, this is equivalent to:</description>

      <description>Activities  Variables and their summary intervals The standard deviation and the summary interval Shapes of distributions The normal distribution   Learning objectives Frame the prediction of an unknown quantity using an interval. Choose the prediction interval endpoints to convey a range of likely outcomes. Understand that predictions are more likely to be right when the interval is constructed to be long. Understand, in contrast to (3), that predictions are more likely to be informative when the interval is short.</description>

      <description>Activities  Distribution shapes Normal parameters Common and rare   Learning objectives  Understand how a distribution summarizes the properties of a collection of individual values. Be able to translate between major forms of representing distributions graphically, e.g.  the density of points in a (jittered) point plot the presentation of such density as a height or width as in a violin or density plot  Be able to eyeball the standard deviation of a close-to-normal distribution and, similarly, a 95% summary interval (that is, mean ± two standard deviations ) Be able to identify common characteristics of skew or long-tailed distributions, by comparison to a normal distribution.</description>

      <description>Activities  What is a confidence interval? Sampling bias and confidence intervals Comparing two groups Comparing two confidence intervals Two-sample t test   Learning objectives connected to confidence intervals  Master the relevant vocabulary … population, sample, sample statistic, point estimate, margin of error, confidence interval, confidence level. Recognize the estimation process that leads to a confidence interval: a sample is selected randomly from a population a statistic is calculated from that sample the margin of error and, correspondingly, the confidence interval are calculated from that sample.</description>

      <description>Activities  Comparing two groups Comparing confidence intervals Two sample t-test   Learning objectives Typical course objectives relating to the t-based test and confidence interval are:
 Confidence interval:  Compute from data the confidence interval on the difference of means. Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the question intended to be addressed with the data.  p-value:  State an appropriate null hypothesis Draw a sketch relating the sampling distribution under the null to the observed difference between sample means, and marking the region of the distribution corresponding to the p-value.</description>

      <description>Activities  Introducing linear regression Describing relationship patterns How much is explained by regression?   Learning objectives connected to linear regression  Create scatterplots for bivariate data using graphing technology where appropriate. Lesson: point plots Sensibly choose which variable should be the response and which the explanatory variable, and know when it does and doesn’t matter. (Other nomenclature for explanatory/response: predictor/response or independent/dependent.) Lesson: response and explanatory variables  External evidence of which direction causation goes, e.</description>
