* Added an `index.html` under hugo-lithium/ to set homepage content.

* Added `word-versions` directory under static.
     - Used `blogdown::build_dir(".")` in lessons directory to build word versions of all lessons.
     - Used OS tools to copy `.docx` files to the `static/word-versions` directory.
     - Added a link at the bottom of each lesson `.Rmd` file to point to the word version.
     
* Figured out how to have a separate style for each of the main directories: topics, lessons, littleapps.
    - under layouts  in the theme, there is a directory with a matching name. The home page, which is mostly copied from `_default/list.html`  is in  that matching directory with the name `list.html`.
