<ul>
<li><p>Added an <code>index.html</code> under hugo-lithium/ to set homepage content.</p></li>
<li>Added <code>word-versions</code> directory under static.
<ul>
<li>Used <code>blogdown::build_dir(&quot;.&quot;)</code> in lessons directory to build word versions of all lessons.</li>
<li>Used OS tools to copy <code>.docx</code> files to the <code>static/word-versions</code> directory.</li>
<li>Added a link at the bottom of each lesson <code>.Rmd</code> file to point to the word version.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Figured out how to have a separate style for each of the main directories: topics, lessons, littleapps.
<ul>
<li>under layouts in the theme, there is a directory with a matching name. The home page, which is mostly copied from <code>_default/list.html</code> is in that matching directory with the name <code>list.html</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
