<h2>Orientation</h2>
<p>There’s an expression about how to accomplish a complex, confusing, and difficult task: <em>One step a at time.</em> The purpose of this lesson is to provide you with a step-by-step procedure for working with data. Each step can be straightforward. Some steps involve informing yourself about the data at hand. Some steps require creativity and insight about the real-world system the data represents. Some steps require application of a particular technical procedure.</p>
<p>Here are steps for getting started with a data frame that’s already available to you.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find out what is the <em>unit of observation</em>, that is, what each row stands for.</li>
<li>Find out what are the <em>variables</em>, the name of each, and what each one stands for.</li>
<li>Choose a <em>response variable</em>.</li>
<li>Select one or more <em>explanatory variables</em> which you suspect might account for the response variable.</li>
<li>Examine <em>how much</em> of the variation in the response variable is accounted for by the explanatory variables.</li>
<li>Describe in words and numbers the <em>pattern of the relationship</em> between the explanatory variables and the response variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this lesson, your’re going to work on steps (1) and (2).</p>

<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>You’ll use the <a href="https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/LA_point_plot/">variables-and-units Little App</a> for this lesson. Open the little app and select the <code>NHANES</code> data.</p>
<p>Steps (1) and (2) are to find out about the data frame: What is the unit of analysis and what are the variables. A standard place to get information about a data frame is the <em>codebook</em> for the data frame, which is the descriptive documentation about the data.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Go to the <strong><em>Codebook</em></strong> tab in the app. The documentation will appear.
The <em>unit of observation</em> is the kind of “thing” each row of the data is about. Read the description section of the codebook. This often contains clues about the unit of observation. Note the words “survey,” “individuals,” “interviewed.”</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think is the unit of observation? <!-- an individual person --></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The variables are described further on in the codebook.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a few variables whose meaning is obvious to you.</li>
<li>Some variables have simple names like <code>Age</code>. Some have names that are more like a codeword, like <code>BPSysAve</code>. Find a few variables with such names and see if the description of the variable’s meaning helps you understand what the variable is about.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
